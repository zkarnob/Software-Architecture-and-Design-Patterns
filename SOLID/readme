1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   - Each class has a single responsibility:
     - `Account` class handles account-related functionalities (deposit and withdraw).
     - `Transaction` interface defines the contract for transaction types.
     - `DepositTransaction` and `WithdrawTransaction` classes implement specific transaction types.
     - `BankService` class acts as an intermediary to perform transactions on the account.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
   - The code is open for extension and closed for modification.
   - The `Transaction` interface allows for new transaction types to be added without modifying the existing classes.
   - For example, if you want to add a new transaction type, you can create a new class that implements the `Transaction` interface without modifying the existing `BankService` or `Account` classes.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - The `DepositTransaction` and `WithdrawTransaction` classes are substitutable for the `Transaction` interface.
   - This means that any instance of `DepositTransaction` or `WithdrawTransaction` can be used interchangeably with `Transaction`, without affecting the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - The `Transaction` interface is small and focuses on a specific contract for transactions (the `execute` method).
   - There are no unnecessary methods in the interface that might not be used by all implementations.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - The `BankService` class depends on the `Transaction` interface rather than specific transaction implementations.
   - This allows the `BankService` to be flexible and work with any class that implements the `Transaction` interface, promoting loose coupling.

Overall, the code follows SOLID principles effectively by promoting single responsibility, extensibility, substitutability, interface segregation, and dependency inversion. These principles enhance the maintainability, flexibility, and reusability of the codebase.
